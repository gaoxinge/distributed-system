/************************
 You need to complete the function deleteKey().

 What you want to do is prompt the user for a key to delete, get that key,
 find the node it belongs to and delete it. Inform the user of the outcome (e.g.
success/failure/...)

 This is a generic declaration that you can modify in any way you see fit.

 FYI, the within the tree structure, the root has "level" 0, and leaves have the
highest level

int deleteKey(char *key) {
    printf("**** Ignore me, please!!!! \n");
