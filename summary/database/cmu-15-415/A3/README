------------ "How to" ------------------------

* Do "make" to compile, load, and test the code.
* SRC has the source files. The 'deleteKey.c' is disabled - ignore it
* "make clean" destroys any old values in the BTREE, and any future
   insertions occur on an empty tree.
* "make spotless" deletes all object and binary files.
* You can verify your outputs with the ones in Tests directory with ".sol" extension.

Using the program:
 Run ./main: the options should be quite clear.

 Use "C" if you want to print a complete listing of the values in the BTREE.
 Use "i" if you wish to insert a set of strings from a file into the BTREE.
 Use "p" to print the values in a particular page of the BTREE.
 Use "s" to search for a key.
 Use "S" to search for a key and also print the documents containing the key.
 Use "]" to print next key without given prefix.
 Use "[" to print previous key without given prefix.
 Use "T" to print the BTREE in an inorder format.
 Use "d" to delete a key (disabled - ignore it)
 Use "#" to print and reset stats
 Use "x" to exit
