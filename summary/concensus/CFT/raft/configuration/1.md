## implementation

- configuration change: leader don't append new cfg until commit all old cfg
- one step: old cfg and new cfg diff at most one server
- append time: use new cfg after append
- fix: leader don't append new cfg until commit entry (no-op) with same term

## proof

We proof by induction. We assume property is right for $\\{e_i\\}\_{1 \leq i \leq {n-1}}$, then we proof property is right for $\\{e_i\\}\_{1 \leq i \leq n}$.
