## implementation

- configuration change: leader don't append new cfg until commit all old cfg
- one step: old cfg and new cfg diff at most one server
- commit time: use new cfg after commit
- fix:

1. 选主vote加一些机制
2. 自动commit倒数第二个cfg
3. commit持久化
4. atomic append

## proof

We proof by induction. We assume property is right for $\\{e_i\\}\_{1 \leq i \leq {n-1}}$, then we proof property is right for $\\{e_i\\}\_{1 \leq i \leq n}$.
